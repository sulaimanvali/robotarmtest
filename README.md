This yellow and black robotic arm came as a build-it-yourself kit from Maplin years ago. The OWI-535 Robotic Arm Edge may also be compatible with this app.
The USB cable needs to be plugged into an Android device directly via a USB OTG host cable or converter shim. Note that USB does not provide power to the robot arm, only communication. You still need batteries inside it. Also, note that your Android device must support acting as the USB host.
